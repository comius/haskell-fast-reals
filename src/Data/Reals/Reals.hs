-- | Reals form an Archimedean field. Topologically speaking, this means that the
-- underlying approximate field @q@ is dense in the reals. Computationally this means
-- that we can compute arbitrarily good @q@-approximations to real numbers. The
-- function 'approxTo x k' computes an approximation @a@ of type @q@ which is within
-- @2^-k@ of @x@.
approxTo :: RealNum q -> Int -> q
approxTo x k =
    error "approxTo not implemented"
    {- the simplest way to implement approxTo is to keep calling
       @approximate x (prec RoundDown n)@ until @n@ is so large that the returned
       interval has width at most @2^(-n-1)@. The center of the
       interval is the approximation we seek.

       There are several possibilities for optimization. Here we describe one. Let
       @a_n@ be the midpoint of the interval @approximate x (prec RoundDown n)@ and
       let @r_n@ be its width. We are looking for @n@ such that @r_n < 2^{ -n-1}@.
       One heuristic is to assume that @r_n@'s form a geometric series. From this we
       can look at three terms of the sequence, say @r_10@, @r_20@, and @r_30@ and
       estimate an @n@ which should give @r_n < 2^{ -n-1}@. If the estimate fails,
       we try something else. The drawback is that we might end up over-estimating
       the needed precision @n@. -}
